# Tinder Archive

I pour my soul out to anyone that will listen on tinder. Maybe this is the reason why I've been so unsuccessful for all of these years. This project is intended to serve as a backup of my conversations in an easy to review format. Maybe I'll learn something when I can review everything all at once.

## Notes

Export matches should be treated as index -> update frequently
    - each match contains the last message sent -> we can filter through which conversations need to be updated
