Thank you very much, I really appreciate that you think it’s beautiful and shared your story with me.\n\nThat’s awesome you tried to make a watch! I’m asked pretty frequently if I make watches since I make jewelry but I wouldn’t even know where to start to be honest. I admire you attempted to make one! It’s a true art. You should give it another go!",
