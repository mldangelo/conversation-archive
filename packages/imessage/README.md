# iMessage

This should be pretty easy - imessages are available as an unencypted sql database.

## Open Questions? 

- Do I copy the database or export conversations?
  - Should I also grab other contextual information? 
- How do we handle merging divergent histories (texts from two computers that haven't synced?)
