We’re on GCP. We have a small user facing site that uses two load balancers (http and https because nginx with cert forwarding was not good enough), a sharded DB on our k8s cluster, multiple pods on different node types, and stack driver for logging. We also do something funky for secret management and use a CDN for hosting static files. I think we get about 1000 visitors per month. Our site only has 2 API calls (newsletter signup and contact form). I really hate the dev ops guy.",
