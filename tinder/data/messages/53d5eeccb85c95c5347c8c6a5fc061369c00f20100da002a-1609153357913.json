        "message": "Hi Miranda. I’m sorry for my delay. I hope you’re able to find an apartment that’s suitable to you. I decided to hang the Gottlieb in my dining room. It’s 9x12 feet, so it takes most of a wall :( I have a (gross) Jenny Saville opposite it. After some self reflection, I think I’m not quite ready to enter the dating market. I need to work on myself first. I’m sorry for leading you on. Good luck finding whatever it is that you’re looking for.",

I run ~ 20 miles per week, usually after work on Tuesday and Thursday, and a longer run on Sunday. Do you mind if I ask what you do? Super interested in the intersection between the arts and commercial real estate.",
