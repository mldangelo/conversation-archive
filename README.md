# Written Conversation Archive Tools

Personal project that is meant to preserve conversations over long periods of time. 

Especially useful when you have trouble trusting sources (ie: losing history when switching computers, if the other person deletes their account, you lose your history).

See individual project folders for more information about how to run each tool.

## Planned Sources

### iMessage

I just provisioned a new laptop and my text message history is missing. My mother died in 2018 and I don't want to lose my old conversations with her.

### Facebook Messenger

### Whatsapp

### Coffee Meets Bagel

Same reasons as Tinder.

## Supported Sources

### [Tinder](./packages/tinder)

Simple script that hits their web api and performs backfills and efficient updates. Also downloads other contextual information such as photos. Comes in handy when you rematch with someone and can review your old conversation.
