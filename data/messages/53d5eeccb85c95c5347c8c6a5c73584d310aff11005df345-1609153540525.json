        "message": "Ah, nice. I visited Stanford for a couple of weeks during my PhD, because I collaborated with one of the astrophysicist there. It’s a very nice campus, although I did find the atmosphere there very competitive. What was the topic of your thesis? Astrophysics to quant wasn’t as big a switch as one might imagine. Obviously a lot of finance knowledge to pick up, but a lot of the statistical and computational methods are very similar. I mostly focus on fixed income. What kind of work are you in now?",

I was the student PI on a university satellite in undergrad, then I worked on a satellite that blew up for a defunct company called planetary resources, then spent a year at planet labs building the worlds largest earth imaging constellation (several hundred satellites), and another university sat when I was a PhD student at Stanford. I didn’t go out of my way for the perseids this year, but will do something special (TBD) for the Geminid.",
