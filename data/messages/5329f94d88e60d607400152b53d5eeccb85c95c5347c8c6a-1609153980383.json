My all time favorite is this place Otto out of Maine/Boston that does a killer mashed potatoes and bacon pizza among other great and genius topping combinations. But I do go with classic margarita in a pinch.",

My overall favorite type of pizza is a thin prosciutto e funghi, but my favorite place makes a really good sausage and roasted red onion, and my favorite slice is a margarita from prince street pizza. What are yours? And what did you do to end up in jail? You seem too nice to have gone to jail, especially in a place called pumpkintown.",
